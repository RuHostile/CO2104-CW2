          <h3>Stir Fry Meal Prep</h3>

          <h4>STEP 1: Prepare the Chicken</h4>
          <p>The first thing that should be done to prepare for your Stir Fry adventures is to prepare the meat. You can choose any meat you like for this and the process Iâ€™m about to explain can be repeated for just about any of the land meats. Seafood would probably be a bit different. There are are few different ways you can velvet meat. You can do it in hot water or hot oil. To keep things more macro friendly I decided to go with the hot water this time. Typically the cooking process is only done for a short time, like 30 seconds to a minute and it finishes cooking in the wok. Because I am making a large amount to store in the freezer, I am going to boil it for 2-3 minutes so that it cooks all of the way through.</p>
